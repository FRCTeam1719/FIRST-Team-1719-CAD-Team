Home of The FIRST Team 1719 CAD SubTeam

I have uploaded a directory structure that should serve as a backbone to the First Team 1719 CAD team and other subteams that interact with the CAD Team. There are folders for the CAD of this year's model as well as folder for supporting documents, a parts library, etc. The chassis is already out of date because Eli and the chassis developers used Autodesk 360 but if we all adopt Github for sharing, we can keep our files in synch. Github is pretty careful about warning about conflicts and can revert with some difficulty if needed but the best defense is open communication between team members so as not to create conflcts in the repository.
